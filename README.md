Here's what your system needs to handle:

Book Inventory: Manage books, each with a specific quantity available.

User Access: Only users with a valid library card can borrow books.

Borrowing Rules:
              Students can borrow up to 3 books for 90 days.
              Teachers can borrow up to 5 books for 180 days.

Late Fees: If a book is returned past its due date, a penalty of 10 rupees per day applies. Your system must calculate and display these overdue charges.

Focus on implementing these core features to manage borrowing, returns, and penalties effectively!
